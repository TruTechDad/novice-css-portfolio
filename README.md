# Novice CSS Portfolio

## Description
In this project, I am creating a professional portfolio web application from scratch. My portfolio will serve as a dynamic and visually appealing platform to showcase my work, skills, and personal information. I will utilize advanced CSS techniques to ensure both functionality and aesthetics, including responsive design, and interactive components.
